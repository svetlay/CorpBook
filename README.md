What is Corpbook?
-------------------
Corpbook is a social mobile app & game which connects to your company’s HR internal application and surfaces selected employee profile information such as name, picture, role or office location for their peers to guess, as well as report inadequate or missing information. 



Why Corpbook? For employees. 
--------------------------
Corpbook helps you gain insights into your visibility within your company. Just by checking your profile you will know if you are making an impact in the organization to the point that everyone knows who you are and what you do. Or, you just need to be showing up in the office cafeteria more. Or pick up the microphone at the next caraoke competition!

Why Corpbook? For organizations. 
------------------------------
If your company has multiple offices or has adopted remote employee policies that today’s Generation-Y demands, Corpbook is for you. 
Corpbook helps you connect employees in a fun and engaging way, nearly a game.  Through our addictive and user friendly mobile application, your employees will be able to browse your corporate directory and be quizzed on: 
- Person displayed on the picture
- Person displayed role
- Person displayed main office location
- Person displayed team
- Recognize a person from three options available
- …and more!
In the process, they will help your organization keep your profile information, especially profile pictures, up to date.
